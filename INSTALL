--- Installation Quick Start ---

Refer to the documentation (Neu Framework Guide) at
http://neu.andrometa.net for complete installation instructions if you
have problems.

1. set environment variable NEU_HOME to point to this directory. Add
$NEU_HOME/bin to your PATH. Add $NEU_HOME/lib to your
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (Mac) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) as appropriate. You
may wish to modify your .bash_profile, .bashrc, etc. to include these
definitions.

2. edit Makefile.defs according to your installation and preference -
the topmost items are the ones which will most likely need to be
modified.

3. make llvm (this step only needs to be done once, the first time you
install)

4. make release (for optimized build) or make (for debug build)
